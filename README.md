# Timed Coding Quiz
This is a timed coding quiz built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The timer will start at 60 seconds and count down by one second. If you get a question wrong, then your time is deducted by five seconds and the DOM will display that you got the question wrong. If you get a question correct, you will have five points added to your total score and the DOM will display that you got the answer correct. At the end of the quiz you can log your name or initials and the application will save your initials and score to local storage. You can click on the highscores button to present you a modal of the existing scores in your local storage.
